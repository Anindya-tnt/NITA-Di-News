This software is aimed at those who feel annoyed by the fact that
you have to wait for the auto scroller to display the news in 
the NIT Agartala website. 

The software is very simple in look and feel. But most importantly,
it lets you have a quick look at all the news and download the ones
necessary.

The software was created using python as part of learning to scrape
data from websites and display only the necessary information when 
required.
